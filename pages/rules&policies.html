            <h3>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein</h3>


            <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
            The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
            team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
            <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    1. DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
                    a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                    adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program must be
                    a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
                    the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                    minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                    field may be required to play all their games away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS

                    </ol>

                </ol>

                <h5> All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast
                    fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged
                    to play their players 50% of each game.
                </h5>
                <p></p>
                <h5> A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                    under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice
                    and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and
                    injuries. </h5>
